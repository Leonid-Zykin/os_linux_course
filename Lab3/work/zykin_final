Morpheus:  I do not believe it to be a matter of hope, Councillor. It is simply a matter of time.
Link:  My stop. See you soon, hopefully not too soon. Let’s go, Kid. These two got things to do.
Neo:  Are you thinking what I’m thinking?
Trinity:  I am if you’re thinking this elevator’s too damn slow.
Neo:  How long to recharge the Neb?
Trinity:  24, maybe 30 hours.
Neo:  Some people go their entire lives without hearing news that good.
Old Woman at Zion:  Neo, please. I have a son, Jacob, aboard the Gnosis. Please, watch over him.
Neo:  I’ll try.
Another Old Woman at Zion:  I have a daughter on the Icarus.
Neo:  No, wait.
Trinity:  It’s all right. They need you.
Neo:  I need you.
Trinity:  I know. There’s time.
Link:  Where’s my puss… Hey!
Link’s Niece and Nephew:  Uncle Link!
Link:  God! Oh my God, you’re so huge, you should be picking me up!
Link’s Niece and Nephew:  No!
